# Views

## Introduction

Lumen allows you to serve HTML content using the View facade and the powerful Blade templating engine.

## Differences From Laravel

There are no differences between using views in Lumen and using views in Laravel; therefore, please consult the [full Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/views) for usage examples.

> **Note:** Before using the `View` facade, be sure you have uncommented the `$app->withFacades()` method call in your `bootstrap/app.php` file.
